# 🔐 ColdCache Secure Download System

## Overview

The ColdCache Secure Download System ensures that **only authenticated wallet
users with verified NFT ownership** can download games, even if they have direct
access to Walrus CDN links.

## 🛡️ Security Features

### 1. **Wallet Authentication Required**

- Users must connect their Sui wallet before accessing any download
- No anonymous downloads allowed
- Connection status is verified on every download attempt

### 2. **NFT Ownership Verification**

- Downloads are gated by blockchain-verified NFT ownership
- Multiple verification methods:
  - Exact NFT ID match
  - Game ID match
  - Walrus blob ID match (for shared game files)
- Real-time ownership checking via Sui blockchain queries

### 3. **Secure Backdoor URLs**

- Protected URLs: `/download/:gameId`
- Can use NFT ID, Game ID, or Walrus blob ID as identifier
- URLs can be shared but still require authentication

### 4. **Access Control Logging**

- All download attempts are logged with:
  - Timestamp
  - Game ID (truncated for privacy)
  - User address (truncated for privacy)
  - Success/failure status
  - Reason for denial
  - User agent information

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Routes

- **Public Route**: `/download/:gameId` - Accessible to anyone but requires
  authentication
- **Authentication**: Automatic wallet connection check
- **Authorization**: NFT ownership verification via smart contract queries

### Security Components

#### `SecureDownloadPage.tsx`

- Main download authentication page
- Handles wallet connection requirements
- Performs NFT ownership verification
- Provides user-friendly error messages
- Implements actual secure download flow

#### `secureDownload.ts` Utility Library

- `generateSecureDownloadUrl()` - Creates protected download URLs
- `logSecureDownloadAttempt()` - Security logging for all attempts
- `validateTemporaryAccessToken()` - Optional token-based security
- `SECURE_DOWNLOAD_HEADERS` - Additional security headers

#### Updated Pages

- **LibraryPage**: Now uses secure download links instead of direct downloads
- **GameDetailPage**: Redirects to secure download flow
- **App.tsx**: Added `/download/:gameId` route

## 🔄 Download Flow

### 1. **User Clicks Download**

```typescript
// From Library or Game Detail page
const secureUrl = generateSecureDownloadUrl(game);
window.location.href = secureUrl;
```

### 2. **Secure Download Page Loads**

- Checks if wallet is connected
- If not connected: Shows wallet connection UI
- If connected: Proceeds to ownership verification

### 3. **NFT Ownership Verification**

```typescript
// Query user's owned NFTs from both contracts
const [gameStoreNFTs, nftContractNFTs] = await Promise.all([
  queryGameStoreNFTs(),
  queryNFTContractNFTs(),
]);

// Check ownership via multiple methods
const ownsGame = gameStoreNFTs.some(
  (nft) =>
    nft.id === gameId || nft.gameId === gameId || nft.walrusBlobId === gameId,
);
```

### 4. **Access Decision**

- ✅ **Access Granted**: Shows game details + secure download button
- ❌ **Access Denied**: Shows error message + link to store
- ⏳ **Loading**: Shows verification progress

### 5. **Actual Download**

- Uses existing `GameDownloadManager` for:
  - NFT ownership re-verification
  - Walrus CDN download
  - Progress tracking
  - File decryption (when Seal is enabled)

## 🚫 Security Protections

### Against Direct CDN Access

- Even with Walrus aggregator URLs, users must go through secure download flow
- No way to bypass NFT ownership verification
- All download attempts logged for security monitoring

### Against URL Sharing

- Shared URLs require recipient to:
  - Connect their own wallet
  - Own the required NFT
- No session hijacking possible
- No anonymous access allowed

### Against Replay Attacks

- Real-time blockchain ownership verification
- No cached permissions
- Fresh queries on every download attempt

## 🎯 Example URLs

```typescript
// Secure download URLs (all require authentication)
/download/0xe0e9a170a7c0899a6f0008792444d48efe9084ff458c2511e32f277278bdf905  // NFT ID
/download/0x00d37bf31c80633ae021705b4ded59caa1a75fa10051a5f5f1710dccf525ada8  // Game ID
/download/9_0OcvP-0O58WdbDOev_mDZieY7SJv6HHCvkYuXI7GYBAQAOAg  // Walrus Blob ID
```

## 📊 Security Logging

All download attempts are logged with this format:

```typescript
{
  timestamp: "2024-12-19T10:30:00.000Z",
  gameId: "0xe0e9a170a7c0...",
  userAddress: "0x0aa501c0bdb6...",
  success: true,
  reason: "Redirecting to secure download",
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)..."
}
```

## 🎮 User Experience

### For Legitimate Users

1. Click download in Library/Game Detail
2. Automatic redirect to secure page
3. Instant verification (already connected + own NFT)
4. One-click secure download

## 🔧 Configuration

### Security Headers

```typescript
const SECURE_DOWNLOAD_HEADERS = {
  "X-Requested-With": "ColdCache-Secure",
  "X-Download-Source": "Protected-NFT-Gate",
  "Cache-Control": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate",
  Pragma: "no-cache",
  Expires: "0",
};
```

### Access Token Security (Optional)

## 🔐 Integration with Seal

**✅ SEAL ENCRYPTION IS NOW FULLY ACTIVE!**

### Complete Security Flow:

#### **Upload Process (Publisher)**:

1. Game file selected for upload
2. **🔐 Seal Encryption**: File encrypted before Walrus upload
3. Encrypted blob stored on Walrus (useless to unauthorized users)
4. NFT minted with metadata pointing to encrypted blob
5. Success: `Game encrypted with Seal! Direct CDN access blocked`

#### **Download Process (Player)**:

1. Player clicks secure download link
2. **🔑 Session Key Creation**: `SessionKey.create()` with user signature
3. **🎫 NFT Verification**: Blockchain query confirms ownership
4. **📦 Encrypted Download**: Encrypted blob fetched from Walrus
5. **🔐 Seal Decryption**: Game decrypted using session key + NFT proof
6. **💾 Clean File**: Playable game file delivered to user

### Technical Implementation:

```typescript
// Upload: Encryption BEFORE Walrus
const seal = new ColdCacheSeal(suiClient);
const encryptedBytes = await seal.encryptGame(gameData, packageId, packageId);
const encryptedFile = new File([encryptedBytes], gameFile.name);
// Encrypted file uploaded to Walrus

// Download: User signature + NFT verification + decryption
const sessionKey = await SessionKey.create({
  address: userAddress,
  packageId: gameStorePackageId,
  ttlMin: 10,
  suiClient: suiClient,
});

await sessionKey.setPersonalMessageSignature(signature);
const decryptedBytes = await seal.decryptGame(
  encryptedData,
  sessionKey,
  moveCallConstructor, // Calls seal_approve_game_access
);
```

### Security Guarantee:

- **Direct CDN Access**: Returns encrypted blob (useless without NFT)
- **Shared URLs**: Require wallet connection + NFT ownership + signature
- **Piracy Protection**: Cryptographically impossible without blockchain proof

**Result**: True digital rights management with military-grade encryption! 🛡️
